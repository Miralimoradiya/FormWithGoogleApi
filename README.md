## ‚úèÔ∏è Description

This project provides an interface where users can start typing an address, triggering the Google Places Autocomplete API. Suggestions are displayed, and when a user selects an address, the form fields (name, street address, city, state, zip code) are automatically populated. Additionally, the selected location is marked on a Google Map below the form, which updates in real time.

This project is ideal for forms requiring location input, such as delivery or address forms.
