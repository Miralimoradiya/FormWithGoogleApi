# React Google Maps Autofill Location Form

This is a React-based project that integrates the Google Maps API to automatically fill out address fields based on the user's location input. The app uses Google Places Autocomplete to fill the location details, such as name, street address, city, state, and zip code. Additionally, it displays a Google Map with a marker on the selected location.

## :pencil2: **Description**

This project provides an interface where users can enter a location, which triggers the Google Places Autocomplete API. The API will suggest possible addresses, and once the user selects an address, the corresponding location details (name, street address, city, state, zip code) are populated automatically. 

It also includes a Google Map that updates in real time with a marker reflecting the chosen location. This app can be particularly useful for location-based services, such as delivery forms or location inputs in apps.
